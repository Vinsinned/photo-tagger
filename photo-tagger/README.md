This is a project that uses the basci concept of the popular game "Where's Waldo?"

FOr my implementation, I decided to do one with the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster as I am too lazy to use an actual Where's Waldo picture as the only thing is to click on a character and validate it.

I first use a onclick on the faces of the characters and log out the x and y position of the characters. I then manually input it into firebase and then when I click on a position and it is 20 under or over the target, it will count it as a win.
